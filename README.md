Making Tax Calcuator to learn more about Flutter .

This is a very simple tax calculator i made to start practicing dart language with Flutter Engine  .
the UI design is inspired by this guy from dibbble https://dribbble.com/shots/2295984-Calculator 


, i tried to add my touch to the design and make the app functional using some Flutter packages like : 

-Audio player package : https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers 

-Range Slider package : https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_range_slider
