  Tax Calculator is a simple project to learn more about Flutter for beginners  .

This is a very simple tax calculator i made to start practicing dart language with Flutter Engine  .
the UI design is inspired by[ this guy from dibbble ](https://dribbble.com/shots/2295984-Calculator) 


, i tried to add my touch to the design and make the app functional using some Flutter packages like : 

 
[-Audio player package ](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers)

[-Range Slider package](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_range_slider)
